# 🚀 AgreeSafe: AI-Powered Terms & Conditions Analyzer  

🔍 **Cut through the legal jargon & identify hidden risks before you click "Accept"!**  

## 🌟 Why AgreeSafe?  
Every day, millions of users blindly agree to **Terms & Conditions** (T&C) without reading them—often exposing themselves to **privacy risks, financial liabilities, and legal restrictions**. Traditional summarization tools **fail to address individual user concerns**, leading to **oversimplified insights** that might **miss critical clauses**.  

📌 **AgreeSafe is different!** Instead of summarizing T&C documents in a **one-size-fits-all** manner, it **searches for high-risk keywords and clauses**—highlighting them directly so that **YOU decide what matters most!**  

---

## 🚨 Why Not a T&C Summarizer?  
Most AI-based summarization tools **compress large documents into predefined formats**, **overlooking user-specific concerns**:  
✅ **User A** worries about **hidden fees & cancellation charges**.  
✅ **User B** is focused on **privacy risks & data sharing policies**.  
🔴 A generic summary might **miss critical aspects unique to each user!**  

**🚀 AgreeSafe doesn’t summarize!** Instead, it **dynamically extracts** risk-prone sentences and displays them **without altering their meaning**—giving you complete control over what you accept!
